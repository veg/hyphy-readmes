## JSON Field Descriptions
*   `BUSTED-PH.Uncorrected P-value.FG`: P-value testing if there is positive selection (omega > 1) specifically on the foreground branches.
*   `BUSTED-PH.Uncorrected P-value.BG`: P-value testing if there is positive selection on the background branches.
*   `BUSTED-PH.Uncorrected P-value.Comparative`: P-value testing if the selective regimes (omega distributions) are statistically different between foreground and background.
*   `fits.Unconstrained model.Rate Distributions.Test`: The inferred distribution of omega rates and their weights for the foreground branches. High weights on omega > 1 indicate positive selection.
*   `fits.Unconstrained model.Rate Distributions.Background`: The inferred distribution of omega rates for the background branches.
